# Transactions Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing **transaction data** using Python.\
The main goal is to explore the dataset, identify useful patterns, and
visualize relationships between variables such as age, yearly income,
and merchant type.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##  Libraries Used

-   `pyodbc` : Connect to databases\
-   `pandas` : Data manipulation and cleaning\
-   `matplotlib` : Data visualization\
-   `seaborn` : Advanced visualizations\
-   `glob` : File handling in directories\
-   `os` : File system operations\
-   `json` : Work with JSON formatted data

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##  How to Run

1.  Make sure you have **Python 3.10+** installed.\

2.  Install the required libraries:

    ``` bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn pyodbc
    ```

3.  Run the main script (example):

    ``` bash
    python main.py
    ```

4.  The analysis results and visualizations will be displayed.

## Expected Outputs

-   Distribution of customers by **age** and **yearly income**\
-   Relationship between **merchant type** and transaction behaviors\
-   Clear and professional visualizations to understand customer
    spending patterns
